Approach to solve the given question:
InputFile function will read the file with the Buffered reader as it is fastest way to read the file in java.
Then line by line each api is passed asynchronously as a get request will send json response.
Jackson object mapper is used because Object mapper is faster than any other traditional method to
compare the json file hence it is imported.
Computable future with InputStream is returned from the get asynchronous method to compare the json object tree respectively.
Then all the above libraries are imported to POM .xml to achieve the result respectively.
